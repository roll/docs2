## What is the Reproducible Research Fellows Programme?

With the Frictionless Data Reproducible Research Fellows Programme, supported by the Sloan Foundation, we are recruiting and training early career researchers to become champions of the Frictionless Data tools and approaches in their field. Fellows will learn about Frictionless Data, including how to use Frictionless tools in their domains to improve reproducible research workflows, and how to advocate for open science. Working closely with the Frictionless Data team, Fellows will lead training workshops at conferences, host events at universities and in labs, and write blogs and other communications content. In addition to mentorship, we are providing successful applicants with stipends of $5,000 to support their work and time during the nine-month long Fellows Programme. We welcomed applications from 8th May 2019 until 30th July 2019.
