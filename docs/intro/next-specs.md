Our specifications follow our design philosophy:

> - Simplicity: seek zen-like simplicity in which there is nothing to add and nothing to take away.
> - Extensibility: design for extensibility and customisation. This makes hard things possible and allows for future evolution -- nothing we build will be perfect.
> - Human-editable and machine-usable: specs should preserve human readability and editability whilst making machine-use easy.
> - Reuse: reuse and build on existing standards and formats wherever possible.
> - Cross technology: support a broad range of languages, technologies and infrastructures -- avoid being tied to any one specific system.
