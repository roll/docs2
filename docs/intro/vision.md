title: Our Vision
---

Frictionless Data shortens the path from data to insight with a collection of specifications and software for the publication, transport, and consumption of data. At the heart of our approach is a deep understanding of the multi-faceted nature of data work, and an emphasis on platform-agnostic interoperability. From consumer spreadsheet software, through to cloud-based services for data analysis, the future of data is frictionless.

Informed by our work building and deploying [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) and learning about various data publication workflows, we have learned that there is too much friction in working with data.  The frictions we seek to remove---in getting, sharing, and validating data---stop people from truly benefiting from the wealth of data being opened up every day.  This kills the cycle of *find/improve/share* that makes for a dynamic and productive data ecosystem.

We provide [a simple wrapper](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) and basic structure for transportation of data that significantly reduces the friction in data sharing and integration, supports automation and does this without imposing major changes on the underlying data being packaged.  We focus on [tabular data](/docs/tabular-data-package/) but any kind of data can be "packaged". Its lightweight and simple nature it is easy to adopt both for data publishers, data users and data tool makers.

We have been working on these and similar issues for nearly a decade, and we think that the time is right for *frictionless data*. Check the GET INVOLVED section above and learn how to help us get there.
